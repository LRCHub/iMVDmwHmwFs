# FIFTY FIFTY – Gravity

```
Stars are shinin'
and we're lookin' up
어쩌면 우릴 따라 밝게 비출 걸
Don't know how
이런 감정은 Can't control
서로 이끌린 맘은
Innocent innocent
또다시 우린 만나게 돼
'Cause nothing can keep
us apart for long no
좀 멀어져 가도 닿길 원해
Always coming back to you yeah
I just can't escape
눈을 감을 땐
You're still in my head
네게로 이끌려
You push and pull me
like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
Push and pull me like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
Wishing on a shooting star
다신 널 만날 수 없었을까 난
What if we never met?
Would we be the same?
날 떠나가도 깊이 빠져들거야
올라가려는 날 붙잡고
더 끌어당긴 너의 Gravity
좀 나쁘지 않지 이 느낌이
So hold me tight
Don't let me go
I just can't escape
눈을 감을 땐
You're still in my head
네게로 이끌려
You push and pull me
like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
Push and pull me like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
I keep falling deeper
so don't ever let me go
널 밀어내 봐도 you pull me back
Can't fight this anymore
네게로 이끌려
I'm helpless
You push and pull me
like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
Push and pull me like gravity
I fall for you every part of me
You push and pull me
like gravity insanity
I'm losing my mind
